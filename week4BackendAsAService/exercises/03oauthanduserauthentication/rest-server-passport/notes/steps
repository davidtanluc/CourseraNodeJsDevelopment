Registering your app on Facebook

Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/ and register your app by following the instructions there and obtain your App ID and App Secret, and then update config.js with the information.
Start your server and test your application. You can log in using Facebook by accessing https://localhost:3443/users/facebook which will redirect you to Facebook for authentication and return to your server.
